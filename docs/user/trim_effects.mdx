# Trim Effects

Based on the [TrimsEffects](https://modrinth.com/mod/trimseffects) mod by [@Lupin](https://modrinth.com/user/Lupin) and [@Luavixen](https://modrinth.com/user/luavixen) but rebalanced and reimplemented as a datapack for use with BetterTrims.

### Notes
- Level 1 effects apply with 2 trims
- Level 2 effects apply with 4 trims
- Ward Trim applys every 15s instead of every second
