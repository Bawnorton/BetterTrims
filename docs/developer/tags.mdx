# Tags

Better Trims provides a few tags to help with property matching and functionality.

## Trim Material Tags
These tags are what are used in the provided datapacks to match trim materials.<br/>
They are located at:
```
data/c/tags/trim_material
```

The entries of each tag should be the registry names of the trim materials (Not what the material is made from) <br/>
E.g. `c:amethyst`:
```json5
{
    "values": [
        "minecraft:amethyst" // Not "minecraft:amethyst_shard"
    ]
}
```
