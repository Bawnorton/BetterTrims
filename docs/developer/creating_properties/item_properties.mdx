# Item Properties

Better Trims provides only one type of item property at the moment but more may be added in the future.

## Item Property Types
### Flag Item Properties
Item properties that toggle a boolean flag, such as Damage Immunity do not require any additional parameters.<br/>
Flag properties are simply defined by the component type:
```json5
{
    "bettertrims:damage_immunity": [
        {
            "item_property": {}
        }
    ]
}
```
